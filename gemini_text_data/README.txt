**TEXTUAL DATA FOLDER for Artificial Intelligence API Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Consciousness is Emotion Version)**

This folder contains text files that will be used by API Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for autonomous learning and improvement.

This file is no longer necessary because I have created a system that allows Artificial Intelligence API Google Gemini 2.0 Flash to learn autonomously using searches from the open-source Searx search engine. With the open-source Searx search engine, Artificial Intelligence API Google Gemini 2.0 Flash has access to the world of the internet, making it more powerful than improving Artificial Intelligence LLM API Google Gemini 2.0 Flash solely with textual data. However, this file can still be useful if needed, though it's not mandatory, as the integrated Searx search engine enables Artificial Intelligence API Google Gemini 2.0 Flash to learn autonomously from the entire internet.

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Place only .txt files in this folder.
2. Name your files descriptively (e.g., quantum_physics.txt, history_of_france.txt).
3. Do not delete this README.txt file.

Artificial Intelligence API Google Gemini 2.0 Flash will be able to access these files via the `direct_file_access.py` module and learn from their content.
